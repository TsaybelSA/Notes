# Notes
Minimalistic SwiftUI notes app
### Description
First fully self-made app, started like tech task from emplyer and grown to project where I wanted to build something similar with standart Apple notes app.
## Features
 - Lock/Unlock notes via FaceID
 - Switch between showing types (collection and table)
 - Add, protect, delete, pin any notes on main screen
## Possible Improvements
- Replace TextEditor (SwiftUI) at EditNoteView to some third-party library text editor to give more fetures to style and edit text
## Requirements
iOS 15+
